# Gusic
Web-based music player

Gusic is a responsive music player with a grid-based album view, built with Bootstrap and HTML/CSS/JS.

## Functionality

### The actual music player

Pretty basic stuff. A play/pause toggle, previous and next track buttons, progress/seekbar combo and track time/duration. "Previous track" button goes to start of the current track if the track has been playing for at least 5 seconds. The whole interface sits in the always-visible navbar.

### Album-playlists

Reaching the end of a track will automatically play the next track. Uses copious amounts of querySelector.

### Grid Sorting

Library can be sorted by album title, artist and release year in ascending or descending order.

### Touch Mode

Just toggles between always visible library metadata and metadata only visible on hover. Called "touch mode" because hovering isn't really a thing with touchscreens.

### Library

The library is currently stored as a JS object array in js/albums.js. The albums.js file can now be automatically generated by running GusicLibraryBuilder with Gusic's root directory as an argument, or by running GusicLibraryBuilder from the root folder. Album art should now be stored in its respective album's folder (technically in the same directory as the first track of an album the program discovers. This also deprecates the img directory, which remains in the repository for demo purposes.).

## Todo:

- 3-position repeat toggle.
- Clustering by artist / year ?
